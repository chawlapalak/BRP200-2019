1. the purpose of namespaces and header files;
Purpose of namespace is to differentiate between the similar identifiers. As multiple programmers working on same project,
might use same or similar names so the namespace that they belong to,will differ them.
Purpose of header files are to reduce the same code that is to be used in the main or source file.
As we can declare the header file in each .cpp file so we can write some code/functions that is going to be used repeatedly and just 
add it in .cpp file via including the header file.

2. why header files should not be compiled;
Header files should not be compiled because when compiler compiles the .cpp files,and in that
 we have already included our header files in .cpp files as #include---.h file.

3. why you should never include .cpp files in another file.
We should never include our .cpp files because compiler is already compiling them once,
if we include it in other files then it is going to be compiled multiple times.
