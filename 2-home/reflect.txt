1)	Why do you need to allocate new dynamic memory for the entire array when you increase
 the size of an existing array of dynamically allocated memory? Why not allocate memory only for the new element?
A: Because arrays are stored in consecutive way of memory and we dont know in case of appending new element in it, if the 
next space is even empty or occupied.The only way we can increase its size is to allocate a new dynamic memory and copy the content
from the previous one to the new one before deleting the old one.


2)	The CellPhone structure stores the model of the cellphone in an array of characters.
 At the end of the program, we do not use the delete operator to deallocate the memory occupied by the model. 
Why don’t we need to use the delete operator on this array itself? Explain and compare with the array of cellphones.

Because model array is a variable that is local to the structure and its storage will be automatically destroyed and it will go out of scope once
 the function ends.But with the array of cellphone we allocated a dynamic memory, that we have to deallocate using the delete operator.


3)	There are two display(...) function definitions.
 How does the compiler know which definition to call from your main function?
Compiler checks the declaration and matches the number of arguments and the type of arguments in the method signature.
And call the appropriate function accordingly.



Quiz 2 Reflection :

What is the difference between a class and a struct?
Struct is by default public and a class is private in nature.
